# Basic-Supermarket
Basic python project criated to practice basic topics and stimulate logic
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project will simulate a shopping in a supermarket "store". The idea of this project came from the need of having "something" to put all the knowledge that i'll acquire through my journey in python, that's why its a "endless project", because i can turn this into a web page (with web development) or an app (with app development). Hope that can be useful to your studies and you're all enjoy :)

1.1 I already created a list of products, in case of your goal is to study the code or just to see how the project works

1.2 If you're wanted to increase more products, just remove the # from these 6 lines:

# OBS:
      - When you're pricing the product, don't forget that a float in python uses ".", not a ",".
      - I got a problem with the sintax of the products (help haha), so when you're get to the part of choose your products
        don't forget to write the name as it is in the menu or the way you put it (for new products).
